# Automated-Teller-Machine-ATM-Application and Banking Package.
# Intro...
This is an Automated Teller Machine(ATM) Application that enables customers to have access to their bank accounts for basic transactions such as checking balance, depositing, withdrawal, and logout functions. The banking application was implemented through the modular programming procedures(modules and packages) for simplicity reasons.

# Modular Programming
Modular programming is used to explain the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application. Functions, modules and packages are all constructs in Python that promote code modularization.
A Python module is a single file, and a package is a folder with potentially multiple files.
